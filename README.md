# keyLogger

This is a basic KeyLogger made using Python. This script will log all keys pressed in a text file, called "keys.txt" 
It is recommended if you try this for yourself to use the absolute path for a keys.txt file. 

It is possible and very useful to have logs emailed to someone, which I will add in a future update to this script. 

If you try this for yourself, make sure you have pynput installed, which you can install by simply typing:
pip install pynput 

To stop logging your key strokes, all you need to do is press esc.
